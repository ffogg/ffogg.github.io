                                    <p> FFOGG stands for Following the Flow Of Gas in Galaxies, and this project essentially aims at doing just that.</p>
                                    
                                    <p> We mainly focus on spiral galaxies, and investigate the physical processes that regulate the flow of gas, from the large-scale and diffuse ISM to the more compact molecular clouds, and ultimately into stars. We want to finally place stars and how they're formed, into their larger context of a spiral galaxy - understand how spiral galaxies perform as star formation engines.</p>
                                    
                                    <p> This is a problem that spans many orders of magnitudes in scales and densities, as it requires being able to resolve star formation within molecular clouds, whilst conscious of the large-scale galactic environment in which those clouds are embedded. We achieve this by using both high-resolution observations of the MW and nearby spiral galaxies, and linking those with dedicated numerical simulations of those same galaxies with sophisticated ISM physics.</p>
                                    
                                    <p> Please explore our research pages for more information about the different parts of the project, and for access to some of our dataproducts. Please get in touch with us if there is any particular data product you'd like to have access to, that you cannot find in these pages.</p>
